## Notes
*  While Parcel is great for simple projects and for this prototype, For a production-ready system I would use a more complex bundler such as Babel in order to have more control.
* I would have liked to have implemented a hover-over highlighting effect of the emails in the Navigation Section if I had some more time. Something akin to what Outlook currently uses, or the minimalistic look that Gmail has.
* While for this prototype no Backend was required, a server for retrieving the messages and data could quite simply be setup with Node.js and Express.
* Moment.js was used for time conversions. While not essential this makes life a whole lot easier!
